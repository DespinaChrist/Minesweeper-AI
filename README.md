# Minesweeper-AI
An AI that plays Minesweeper using discrete mathematics to infer knowledge, implemented in Python with Pygame.

## Description
This project implements an AI that can play Minesweeper, a popular puzzle game where the player must uncover hidden mines on a grid while avoiding detonating them. The AI uses discrete mathematics to infer knowledge about the board and make the best decisions, similar to how a human player would solve the game. The game includes a simple Pygame-based GUI that allows you to see the AI's progress and interact with the game.

## Requirements
This project requires Python 3 and Pygame to be installed on your machine. You can install Pygame using pip by running the following command:
```
pip install pygame
```


## Usage
To run the Minesweeper AI on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/DespinaChrist/Minesweeper-AI.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd Minesweeper-AI
```
3. Run the game:
```
python runner.py
```
